## Getting KrampUI
### Download the binary,
- [Standalone Application](https://git.snipcola.com/snipcola/KrampUI/releases/download/latest/krampui.exe) (single .exe)
- [Bundled Installer](https://git.snipcola.com/snipcola/KrampUI/releases/download/latest/krampui-installer.msi) (install as application)

### or... compile it yourself!
1. Ensure you have `cargo` (`rustup`), `node`, and `npm` installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run start` or `npm run build` depending on what you need.
4. Access the executable at `src-tauri/target/release` or `src-tauri/target/debug`.

## You'll still need to buy Ro-Exec
This repository does not contain Ro-Exec, nor does this project allow you to get it for free. You'll need the login token on the [loader.live](https://loader.live/dashboard) site to use this application.
